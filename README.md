Hi! People tend to call me by the moniker kognise.

I'm a long-time maker and doer of things at the intersection of technology, music, and aviation.

As a professional jack-of-all-trades-master-of-some I have experience with the New Thing, but also the Old Thing.

You can find me [on my website](https://kognise.dev/) and also in the infinite void of nothingness.
