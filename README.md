**hi! people tend to call me kognise.**

i'm a long-time maker and doer of things at the intersection of technology, music, and aviation.

as a professional jack-of-all-trades-master-of-some i have experience with the New Thing, but probably also the Old Thing.

if you wish to find me, you can look on [my website](https://kognise.dev/) and in the void of space. [ðŸŒƒ ðŸ’–](mailto:hi@kognise.dev)
